# tools.comskip
*tools.comskip* is an LibreELEC tool addon based on comskip (https://github.com/erikkaashoek/Comskip/) by Erik Kaashoek. Comskip detects commercial breaks from a video stream. It can be used for post-processing recordings.

## Building
*tools.comskip* must be built from within the LibreELEC build system.
The contents of the tools.comskip directory must be copied to 
'/packages/addons/'.

Currently, it should be possible to build for all platforms but it is only tested on x86_64.
